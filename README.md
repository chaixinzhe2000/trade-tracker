## Description
Trade Tracker is a simple command line interface that helps users to log and analyse their tradings. The motivation of building this tool derives from my wish to see the realized profits (or sometimes losses) after I execute a SELL order. The broker that I currently use, Robinhood, does not support this feature.

## Progress
The logging function (along with data validation) is completed. The next step is to write the data into the excel file.

## How to Use this Tool
### Getting Started
First, clone this repository to your local computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/chaixinzhe2000/trade-tracker.git
```
Second, make it a Python executable (you will need Python 3.x and pip installed):
```
pip install -e /path/to/script/folder
```
The tool should be able to run by now, by the command below:
```
trade -h
```
